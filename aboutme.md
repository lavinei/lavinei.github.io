Hi, I'm a PhD Candidate in Statistical Science at Duke University. I'm working with [Prof. Mike West](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mw/) and [84.51](https://www.8451.com) on forecasting daily grocery store sales for thousands of items. I'm developing efficient Bayesian time series models to tackle this high-dimensional problem, along with a  [Python Package](https://lavinei.github.io/pybats/) for standard dynamic generalized linear models (DGLMs). My previous project with [Prof. Mike West](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mw/) and [Michael Lindon](https://michaellindon.github.io) is [Adaptive Variable Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06580v1). We develop a strategy for time-adaptive model combination and forecasting, targeted at a specific objective.

In the summer of 2018, I worked as a Machine Learning and Relevance Intern at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com). I contributed to the ranking algorithm for content in the LinkedIn Feed, and specifically to an intiative which provides attention to lesser known LinkedIn members. I built predictive models for clicks, likes, and comments in Spark and Scala, and a multi-objective optimization routine in R.

Prior to graduate school, I lived in Philadelphia, working for [Thorogood](https://www.thorogood.com) as a Business Intelligence Consultant. I helped to design and build a suite of interative Tableau dashboards for a multinational consumer packaged goods company.

In 2014, I received my bachelors from [Lafayette College](https://www.lafayette.edu) in Easton, PA, with a dual degree in Mathematics and Chemical Engineering.

Apart from Statistics, I enjoy reading, learning about history, and playing games of all types. I'm an avid [Bridge](https://www.bridgebase.com) player, along with many board games and sports.
