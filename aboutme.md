Hi, I'm a PhD Candidate in Statistical Science at Duke University. My current research project with [Prof. Mike West](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mw/) and [84.51](https://www.8451.com) is on Bayesian forecasting techniques for product sales. I'm interested in developing computationally efficient models for forecasting high-dimensional data. My recently submitted paper with [Michael Lindon](https://michaellindon.github.io) and [Prof. Mike West](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mw/) is [Adaptive Variable Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06580v1). We develop a strategy for time-adaptive model combination and forecasting targeted at a    specific objective.

In the summer of 2018, I worked as a Machine Learning and Relevance Intern at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com). I helped to build a multi-objective optimization routine for spreading user attention across the LinkedIn network.

Prior to graduate school, I lived in Philadelphia, working for [Thorogood](https://www.thorogood.com) as a Business Intelligence Consultant. I helped to design and build a suite of interative Tableau dashboards for a multinational consumer packaged goods company. I also worked with data visualization tools such as Power BI, Quik, and Excel.

In 2014, I received my bachelors from [Lafayette College](https://www.lafayette.edu) in Easton, PA, with a dual degree in Mathematics and Chemical Engineering.

Apart from Statistics, I enjoy reading, growing house plants, and playing games of all types. I'm an avid [Bridge](https://www.bridgebase.com) player, along with many board games and sports.
