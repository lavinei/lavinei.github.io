A new paper - [Adaptive Variable Selection for Sequential Prediction in Multivariate Dynamic Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06580) - by Mike West, Michael Lindon, and myself has been released on ArXiV. In the paper, we discuss the advantages of comparing models using a specific objective function, rather than model likelihood. The need for well defined objectives is particularly clear in dynamic models. In a time-series setting model likelihood is the product of 1-step forecast densities.

We develop a strategy for dynamic variable selection in a multivariate modeling setting. We create synthetic Gibbs Probabilities based on model scores, which come from an objective function - such as long-term forecasting. We find groups of high scoring models near our current 'best' model, and forecast with a weighted combination models.

An example with 3 macroeconomic series shows that using long-term forecasting for model scores produces - as expected - far superior forecasts over long-horizons than standard Bayesian model probabilities. The figure above illustrates this in the marginal forecast error of all 3 series.  We also consider using the joint multi-step forecast distribution (path forecast distribution) as a model score. This produces models that balance their long and short term forecast accuracy. Shown below are forecasts from a combination of models using this score for the series of monthly US Inflation.
